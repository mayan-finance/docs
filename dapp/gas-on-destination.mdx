title: "Gas On Destination"

The "Gas on destination" feature in our cross-chain swap protocol is an exciting addition that provides users with the ability to receive gas on the destination chain along with their output tokens so they can perform transactions on the destination chain right after the swap!

If user already has some gas on their destination wallet the "Gas on destination" feature won't appear by default.

Users also have the flexibility to adjust the gas amount within certain limits:

### Gas on destination default and max values:
