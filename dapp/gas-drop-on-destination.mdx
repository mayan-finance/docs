title: "Gas Drop On Destination"
---

The "Gas drop on destination" feature automatically provides native gas tokens along with the output assets on the destination blockchain, enabling users to immediately perform transactions after a cross-chain swap without needing to fund gas separately.

If the destination wallet already holds sufficient native gas tokens, this feature will not be triggered by default.

Users can adjust the amount of gas they receive within predefined limits specific to each supported blockchain:
