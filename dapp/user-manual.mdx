### Swap Tokens

To swap tokens on Mayan all you need is a [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or a Solana wallet. You can also use any wallet that supports [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) protocol.

The process is really similar to native swaps.

Example cross-swap from Avalanche to Solana:

</Frame>

<Info>
Please pay attention to the price impact percentage, it shows how much your swap affects the price of tokens on that market, so if it's high, it means you are not getting an ideal deal.
