**What it is:**\
Relayers are independent entities that deliver authenticated messages between blockchains in Mayan, playing a key role in cross-chain swaps.

**How it works:**

- Relayers monitor supported blockchains for Mayan transactions.
- When a swap is detected, they retrieve Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs) from Wormhole guardians.
- Using the VAA, relayers commit the message on Solana or another target network, completing the transaction.
- Relayers earn a fee for covering network costs and acting on behalf of users.

**Why it matters:**\
Relayers never access or control users’ funds. The Solana program is trustless, enabling anyone to run their own relayer and participate in message transfer—no permissions needed. This ensures swaps remain secure and decentralized for all users.
