WH Swap Bridge is a permissionless, open-source bridge built on Wormhole primitives and developed by the Mayan team to facilitate cross-chain, one-click token swaps.

The Token Bridge, a widely recognized component of the Wormhole ecosystem, facilitates cross-chain token transfers using a mint-and-burn mechanism. To expand its functionality, we leveraged Wormhole's generic message-passing capabilities to design a new bridge tailored for cross-chain swaps. This innovative structure embeds swap-specific information alongside a reference to the Token Bridge message. Upon relayers delivering these messages on Solana, drivers are equipped with all the data needed to seamlessly engage in the Mayan swap auction.

Post-auction, the winner becomes responsible for swapping the tokens in a flash swap transaction. In this atomic transaction, the winner receives the funds and must send the promised output amount within the same transaction.

After the successful execution of the swap, if the destination address is on Solana, the relayer simply transfers the output token to the user's wallet. Otherwise, the relayer uses a token bridge to send the tokens to the destination chain.

Here is an overview of what happens when a user executes a cross-chain transaction on Mayan:
