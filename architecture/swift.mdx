Swift is the intent-based method for fast bridging and cross-chain swaps. In this method, instead of sending funds directly to the destination chain, the user creates an order by locking the funds on the source chain. The Mayan network of Drivers sees this order and starts an auction on Solana to find the best provider among themselves. The winner of the auction is responsible for fulfilling the order on the destination chain. Once the order is fulfilled, the driver receives a receipt, which can be used to unlock the funds on the source chain. Swift protocol fee is set to 3 basis points.
