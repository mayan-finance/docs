**What it is:**\
A transparent, on-chain auction on Solana where drivers compete to offer users the most favorable swap price for cross-chain transfers.

**How it works:**

- Each swap request triggers a 3-second English auction.
- Drivers submit bids focused on offering the best rate, not the fastest response.
- The best price wins, and the winner executes the swap at their quoted rate.

**Why it matters:**\
Unlike typical RFQ models—which lead to gas wars and MEV extraction—Mayan’s auction system is designed to maximize value for users through true price competition.

**Get involved:**\
To become a solver (“driver”), open a support ticket in the Mayan Discord and request access. Applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

**Design note:**\
Mayan refers to solvers as “drivers,” it;'s a nod to the Mayan team’s roots in building ride-sharing routing algorithms.
